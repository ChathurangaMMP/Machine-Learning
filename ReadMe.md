# Machine-Learning
This repository contains ***Python 3*** programming language. The models are created using ***sklearn*** library. Also, ***numpy***, ***pandas***, ***seaborn*** and ***matplotlib*** libraries are used to perform processes in notebooks. 

### **Important: These notebooks contain many methods that can be used to perform data processing. All of this may or may not require to build a model. I include them here because my goal is to collect all of these in to single place.**
